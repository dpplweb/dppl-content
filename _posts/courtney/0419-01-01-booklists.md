As a parent, you know your child best.  Getting them to read can be tricky, but it is easier when you pick books that are about their intersts or the type of books they like. Most of the links below will take you directly to the catalog, where you can read summaries and reviews or place a hold on any materials you want.

**To help you find picture books, we created lists by subject:**
