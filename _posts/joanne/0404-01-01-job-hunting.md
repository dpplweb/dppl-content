## Help at the Library

When you are looking for employment there are three activities that are part of the process. You can use the library’s resources to enhance the success of these activities.

1. Resume Writing. Use your library card to access the [resume module](http://alc.brainfuse.com/alc/resume.asp) of the Adult Learning Center/HelpNow. Then use the templates, upload you document and within 24 hours you will receive an edited copy. Don’t want online assistance but want to see lots of examples of resumes and cover letters? Here is a link to the [latest books](http://dppl.bibliocommons.com/search?t=subject&search_category=subject&q=resumes&commit=Search&sort%5bfield%5d=NEWLY_ACQUIRED&sort%5btype%5d=BIB_FIELDS&sort%5bdirection%5d=descending ).

2. Job Searching. [ReferenceUSA](http://www.referenceusa.com/Home/Home) will help you build a customized search for companies that you may want to be employed by. Each individual company search entry with include a list of their competitors or firms in similar industries. If you need help building customized searches call or email the Reference department.

3. Networking. Connecting to industry or professional associations can lead to job banks or to social opportunities where you meet people currently employed in your areas of interest. The keyword searches in the [Encyclopedia of Associations](http://find.galegroup.com/gdl/dispAdvSearch.do?method=getFields&selectedTab=T024&prodId=GDL&userGroupName=des87360&advancedSearchType=DIRECTORIES&finalAuth=true) will help you discover those groups.
