##6th Annual Family Science Expo Happens October 11th 2014

We love getting kids excited about learning and the Des Plaines Library's Family Science Expo is the perfect family activity. Perfect for all ages, families can explore different science organizations and see amazing things. Science Expo has been a yearly tradition for the past 5 years and we're excitedly planning our 6th. Make sure to mark this date on your calendar.
