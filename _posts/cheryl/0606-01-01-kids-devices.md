Our department has many preloaded digital devices. From youngest to oldest, we've got you covered.

###Nooks
We have twelve Nooks available to checkout. Whether it's picture books, graphic novels, or fiction, there is something for all ages. Books are already set up on the device so all you have to do is take them home and read. Our Nooks come in a plastic case to keep everything together, and includes a directional sheet and charger. Perfect for voracious readers.
