The Youth Services staff loves creating and presenting programs for children of all ages, from birth through 8th grade. Every year we present over 100 programs. Below is a small sampling of what kids can do here. Make sure to view the calendar to see current programs and what's coming soon.

###Storytime
We have storytimes for all ages. Available at different days and times, there's something for everyone. See the calendar for additional information.

###Outside Entertainment
Magicians, singers, live animals-oh my! The library brings in special entertainers  

###Crafts
We love being crafty at the library. We'll have simple crafts at Kids Get Crafty and creative projects for older kids at Art Attack. 

###Gaming
From board games to video games, gaming is a staple at the library. We celebrate International Games Day every November, have Family Game Night each Thursday, and other gaming opportunities. 

###Science and Technology
No matter the age we have science and technology programs for all children.
