The Youth Services staff loves creating and presenting programs for children of all ages, from birth through 8th grade. Every year we present over 100 programs. Below is a small sampling of what kids can do here. Make sure to view the calendar to see current programs and what's coming soon.

###Storytime
We have storytimes for all ages. Available at different days and times, there's something for everyone. See the calendar for additional information.

###Outside Entertainment
Magicians, singers, live animals-oh my! The library brings in special entertainers  

###Crafts
We love being crafty at the library. We'll have simple crafts at Kids Get Crafty and creative projects for older kids at Art Attack. 

###Gaming
From board games to video games, gaming is a staple at the library. We celebrate International Games Day every November, have Family Game Night each Thursday, and other gaming opportunities. 

###Science and Technology
No matter the age we have science and technology programs for all children. Little Learners for the little ones, Tech DIY for 4th-8th graders, and our Annual Family Science Expo are a small sample of some of the science and technology programs you'll find at the library.

Whatever the interest, whatever the age, the Youth Services department makes sure to create, present, and host a wide range of entertaining and educational programing. Be sure to check out our calendar for all upcoming programs.
