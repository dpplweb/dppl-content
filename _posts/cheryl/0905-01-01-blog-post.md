The Youth Services Staff is really excited about our new website and we hope you are too! We've redesigned our Parent and Kid pages to make information easy to find and highlight some things that maybe you didn't know about. Find the Parents and Kids pages under Guides at the top right of the page and we'll go ahead and start our brief tour. Please keep your hands inside the vehicle at all times and hold all questions until the end.

On the Parents page you'll learn about our Parent Collection that you'll find on the 2nd floor. The books here are all about issues that parents may face, from toilet training to difficult teens. Also highlighted is our Museum Pass program--you can get free passes to area museums with your Des Plaines Library card!

Of course, parents will find all sorts of other information on the website: downloadable materials (songs, magazines, and books), general library information, discover new things like Frugal Friends and the DPPL Writing Group. 

Next stop is the Kids page. What's called out here is important things to know about the 2nd floor that kids might not know about, written in kid friendly language. We have eReaders and tablets for all ages. 

And make sure your kids utilize the Kids page. Information that's important to them is written in kid friendly language.
