Parents: Shopping at the grocery store with your kid and need to keep them entertained?

Kids: It's 9:30 at night and you want a book. The library's closed. What can you do?

The library has several different options whatever your age or need.

## Checkout Digital Books and Audiobooks

You might think e-books are only for adults, but there are tons of titles available for kids. Rick Riordan books? We've got that. _Fancy Nancy_? Ditto. _Divergent_? Yup! Titles like these are a click away on either your computer or your digital device (smartphone, tablet, e-reader). 

Digital books and audiobooks are just like regular books. Think of the website we use, MyMediaMall, as another kind of library. You can look around, create a wish list of titles to get in the future, check out books, and put things on hold. This is just another way of getting things you want.

Click on [MyMediaMall](http://www.mymediamall.net/54B63257-767F-46EA-B648-E1895F4E2321/10/50/en/Default.htm) to access the library's catalog of digital books and audiobooks. 

If you have a digital device like a smartphone or tablet, search for the Overdrive app. Download (it's **free**!) and start using it to find e-materials.
