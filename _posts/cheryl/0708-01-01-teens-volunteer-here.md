If you're here, it's because you're interested in giving back to your community. Maybe you want to be a volunteer because you're looking for a fun thing to do in your free time. Maybe you have to volunteer for school. Whatever the reason, we can help you figure out what to do.

##Volunteer in the Youth Services Department

If you're in grades 6th-12th, consider being a Youth Services Volunteer! Volunteer assist in programs and help librarians with tasks. To volunteer, you need to fill out the application and return it to the 2nd floor Youth Services Desk. Sample jobs include:
- Making supplies for storytimes
- Folding brochures 
- Cleaning, dusting, organizing

Volunteers must promise to do a minimum of 8 hours of volunteering -- basically, four 2-hour shifts. Check out the application for more information.

Doesn't sound interesting? Read the other two options and see what you think.

##Join the Teen Advisory Board

Teen Advisory Board (aka TAB) is for 7th-12th graders. TAB is where teens come to tell us librarians what the library should be doing for teens like you. We fill each one hour once-a-month meeting with silliness, high energy, snacks to get you talking, and just a little bit of work. Perfect for meeting other teens, TAB will get you hooked and you'll keep showing up.

TAB meets one Thursday a month from 4-5pm. 

##Make Cards for Hospitalized Kids

One Saturday a month, the Teen Lounge is the place to be to make cards for kids in the hospital. We supply the materials and suggested messages--you supply your creativity and energy. The kids who receive the cards are really grateful so it's a special way to donate your time. Perfect for 6th-12th graders.

Cards for Hospitalized Kids happens one Saturday a month from 1-3pm (but you can show up for 30 minutes or the full 2 hours--up to you and your schedule).


###I Don't Like Any of These Options

Volunteering is personal. Sure, you might have to volunteer because your parent is telling you to, but you'll get more out of it and have more fun if it's something you care about. Cleaning and organizing are not for everyone--I'm not offended if you don't sign up!

###I Need Court Manadated Service Hours

I'm sorry, but the library can't help you earn court manadated service hours. Please check out the link below to find organizations you can fulfill your time with.
