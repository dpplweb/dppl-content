Forgot your library card? No problem! Now your smartphone can be your library card!

## How it works
Using your smartphone as your library card is pretty simple. Here's how it works:

- Install a loyalty card app on your phone (see instructions below)
- Select your books and other library materials (clearly the hardest part)
- Go to the self-checkout machine with the "SmartScan" sign
- Hold your phone up to the scanner

That's it. Now let's get a loyalty card app on your device

## Installing card app

Just follow these steps to install CardStar or Keyring on your phone and add your library card.

### Card Star

- Download the Cardstar app for your phone
- Open the CardStar app
- Touch the plus sign (+) button to add a card
- Select "Des Plaines Public Library" in the list of merchants (you can scroll or search)
- Enter your library card number in the "Card Number" box (Scanning your card will not work)
- Touch the check mark in the upper corner to finish

### Key Ring

- Download the Key Ring app for your phone
- Open the Key Ring app
- Touch the "Add Card" button on the menu (press the "Menu" button to make it appear)
- Touch the "Won't Scan" button in the lower right
- Select "Des Plaines Public Library" from the list of merchants
- Enter your barcode number in the "Barcode Number" box
- Touch the "Create Card" button to finish

That's it! There are other options out there too. Give them a try, these are just the two apps we've tested and used on a regular basis.
