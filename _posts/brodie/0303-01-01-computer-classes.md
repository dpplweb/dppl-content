Taking a computer class is a great way to learn a new skill whether your reasons are personal or professional. We offer a variety of entry level and intermediate classes on topic ranging from producivity software to social media.

It's easy to view upcoming classes through our online calendar. You also can download the current catalog of classes.

## Taking computer classes at the library
We hold our computer classes in the 4th floor computer lab. Most of our classes last 1.5 hours. They're designed to be hands-on and last for one session. Feel free to repeat a class to improve your skils. 

### Special requirements

Occassionaly our classes require you to have a basic set of skills before you show up. Other classes ask you to sign up for a particular service ahead of time. We try to make it clear when this is the case.

## How to register for computer classes

Register online from the calendar. Click on a event and complete the registration form. You can also call and register over the phone by calling the Reference Desk at 847-376-2841.

Registration open on the 15th of the month prior to the next session.

## Suggest a class

Is there something you'd like to learn about that we don't offer? Get in touch with me and suggest a topic for a class. Doesn't have to be too specific. We'd love to hear your input.
