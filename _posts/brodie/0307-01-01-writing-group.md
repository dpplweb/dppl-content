Need inspiration? Looking for a friendly community of writers? Join the DPPL Writing Group and spark your creative energies.

## Attending meetings

The writing group holds official meetings on the first Tuesday of every month at the library. The group regularly holds informal meetings throughout the month.

During a typical meeting, participants respond to writing prompts, share ideas and resources, and critique a featured piece of writing for the week.

## Joining the group

Not sure if you're right for the group? Are you looking for:

- Honest, but friendly feedback on your work
- A supportive community of writers

Do you write:

- Novels
- Short stories
- Poetry
- Creative non-fiction

If so, then you're perfect for the group. You don't need to be an aspiring professional writer, just have a passion for writing and a willingness to give and take friendly feedback.

Get in touch with me to find out more (you can find my info on this page).

## Other activities

The Writing Group also participates in other activities like [National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo)](http://nanowrimo.org/) every November.
