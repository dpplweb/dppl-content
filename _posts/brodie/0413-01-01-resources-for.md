## Resources

We curate resources across a wide range of topics and subjects areas. You can find old newspaper articles or generate business leads. You get special access to these resources as a library patron. The best part? You can use most of these online resources from home with your library card!

### "In library only" resources

As you browse through our lists of resources, you might notice some are labelled "In library only". In some instances, the company that makes the resources doesn't allow us to offer access to home. But don't worry! Just stop by the library and we'll be happy to help you.

### Look for the "favorites"

Like children, we love all of our online resources. They each have a unique purpose and strength. But some are so helpful or useful that we tell when they are favorites.

## Subjects

We offer you acces to a lot of content through the online resources we have. But sometimes, you need to hone in a specific topic. We group our online resources by categories like Health, Job hunting, and more. 

## Kids' subjects

For parents and kids looking for help with a school assignment, be sure to visit our Kids' subjects pages. You'll find topics that match most of the areas that kids cover in Des Plaines schools. All of the information is kid friendly and easy-to-use.

## Getting help

We know that diving into some of these resources can be daunting. Feel free to ask me questions. You also can call the Reference Desk at (847) 376-2841 or text us on your mobile device at (847) 220-8398.
