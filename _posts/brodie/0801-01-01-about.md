[intro para]
The Des Plaines Public Library serves a catalyst, advocate and place to advance the vision and ideals of our community.
[/intro para]

We've been working hard for over 100 years to be an essential resource for Des Plaines. Whether it's through the items we buy for the collections, the programs we run for enrichment or fun, or the partnerships we foster with the community, we want to be a valuable part of your daily life. 

## Values

Our library values guide how we serve you. We hope you see these values reflected in everything we do.

1. Generosity
2. Good design / beauty
3. Friendliness / kindness
4. Efficiency

## Embodying our mission and values

Our staff, board, and building all embody our mission and values. We strive to make our day-to-day operations as transparent as possible by posting freely available meeting minutes (and videos) as well as a variety of data to download and review.
