We have several reading clubs to help engage your children in reading. These are designed to be informal, fun reading experiences and are _not_ regularly scheduled programs held at the library. 

##Bluestem Award Club (for grades 3 - 5)
Join our Bluestem Club. For children in grades 3 - 5 who do not already participate in a Bluestem program at school. Help select the next winner of the [Bluestem Readers Choice Award](http://www.islma.org/Bluestem.htm). Read or listen to at least four of the 20 nominated books to be eligible to vote for your favorite in February. [Get the current booklist and start reading!]()
