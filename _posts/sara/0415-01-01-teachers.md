We have a variety of services to enhance your curriculum. Here are just a few:

##School Library Cards
All schools, preschools, and day care centers located within incorporated Des Plaines (excluding hhome-based centers) are eligible for a library card. To receive a library card, request an application from the Registration Desk at 847-376-2787 or 
[download the application](http://dppl.org/youth/schoolcard.doc).


##Teacher Bookbags
If you teach at a preschool, elementary, or middle school in Des Plaines, we can provide you with a selection of materials to use in your classroom or help your students with their research needs. If you would rather select your own materials, or if you teach at a school that is not located in Des Plaines, we'll be happy to assist you in person. 

###How Teacher Bookbags Work
- Usually, requested materials are checked out to your school's library card; however, if you don't have immediate access to the card, you may use your personal libary card. (If you don't live in Des Plaines, you may still use your personal library card to check out our materials. Depending on the library, you may need to register your card with us in person.) _Please note that the cardholder is responsible for any lost or damaged items._ 

- Request materials [online](online form), in person, or by calling us at 847-376-2839. We will select up to 25 books, CDs, or nonfiction DVDs (by special arrangement), based on availability of materials. _Please allow three to five school days for your bookbag to be prepared._

- These materials are yours to use for four weeks. If know that your unit will last longer than four weeks, you can request an 8-week vacation loan at the time of check-out.

- We'll hold your bookbag for __three school days__ after your requested pick-up date. After that time, the materials will be reshelved unless you call us to make new arrangements.


##Library Visits
We love seeing your students in the library! Unless you have a special request, most library visits consist of an age-appropriate storytime, a brief tour of the Youth Services Department, and time for browsing. Elementary students may also enjoy a pictoral scavenger hunt. Please schedule visits at least three weeks in advance. Visits are based upon staff availability for a given day, so alternative dates are always helpful.

To schedule a library visit for preschoolers, please contact Courtney Schade, Preschool Liaison Librarian, at cschade@dppl.org or 847-376-2797.

To schedule a library visit for elementary or middle school students, please contact Sara McLaughlin, School Liaison Librarian, at smclaughlin@dppl.org or 847-376-2795.
