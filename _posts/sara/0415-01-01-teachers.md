If you teach at a school in Des Plaines, we can provide you with materials to use in your classroom or help your students with their research needs. Schools that are located within incorporated Des Plaines are entitled to a library card that can be used to check out curricular-related materials. [library card information]( "Learn")how to get a school library card.]

If you would like us to provide you with a **Teacher Bookbag**, please [Bookbag Form]( "tell")us what materials would be helpful.
