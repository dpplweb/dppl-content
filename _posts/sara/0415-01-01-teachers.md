We have a variety of services to enhance your curriculum. Here are just a few:

##School Library Cards

If your school is located in incorporated Des Plaines, your building is entitled to a Des Plaines library card which can be used to check out curricular-based materials. These cards are good for one year and may be used by any teacher in your school to check out library materials. Please check with your principal or media specialist if you'd like to take advantage of this service. [Do we want to link to library card info? Or give a contact number for more information?]


##Teacher Bookbags

If you teach at a preschool, elementary, or middle school in Des Plaines, we can provide you with a selection of materials to use in your classroom or help your students with their research needs. We will select up to 25 books or CDs (nonfiction DVDs are also available by special arrangement) on subjects of your choosing based on availability. These books are yours to use for four weeks. If you need them longer, you may renew them as long as another patron hasn't requested them. Or, if you know ahead of time that your unit will extend beyond four weeks, you can request an 8-week vacation loan at the time of check-out.


If you would like us to provide you with a **Teacher Bookbag**, please [tell] ( us what materials would be helpful or call us at 847-376-2839.  **[THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED!!!]** Please allow a minimum of three school days. Bookbags will be reshelved three school days after your requested pick-up date unless if you do not call us or pick up the books.


##Teacher Bookbags 2.0
If you teach at a preschool, elementary, or middle school in Des Plaines, we can provide you with a selection of materials to use in your classroom or help your students with their research needs. If you would rather select your own materials, or if you teach at a school that is not located in Des Plaines, we'll be happy to assist you in person. 

###How Teacher Bookbags Work
-Usually, requested materials are checked out to your school's library card. If you don't have immediate access to the card or if you'd prefer to use your personal libary card, you may certainly do so. __Please not that the cardholder is responsible for any lost or damaged items.__
