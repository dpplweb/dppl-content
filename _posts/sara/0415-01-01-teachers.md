We have a variety of services to enhance your curriculum. Here are just a few:

##School Library Cards

If your school is located in incorporated Des Plaines, your building is entitled to a Des Plaines library card which can be used to check out curricular-based materials. These cards are good for one year and may be used by any teacher in your school to check out library materials. Please check with your principal or media specialist if you'd like to take advantage of this service. [Do we want to link to library card info? Or give a contact number for more information?]


##Teacher Bookbags

If you teach at a preschool, elementary, or middle school in Des Plaines, we can provide you with a selection of materials to use in your classroom or help your students with their research needs. We will select up to 25 books based on availability. These ooks are yours to use for four weeks. If you need them longer, you may renew them as long as another patron hasn't requested them. If you know ahead of time that your unit will extend beyond four weeks, you can request an 8-week vacation loan at the time of check-out.

###Would you like to request non-fiction DVDs for your classroom unit?

We're happy to include relevant audiovisual material in your bookbag. Because DVDs normally only check out for seven days, extended use of these items is by special arrangement only. Please let us know what you need so that we can do our best to accommodate you. 

If you would like us to provide you with a **Teacher Bookbag**, please [tell]( "tell")us what materials would be helpful.  **[THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED!!!]**
