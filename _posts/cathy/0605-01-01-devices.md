### More details about our devices
Devices checkout for 4 weeks and are not renewable. Some of the devices are bundled with award winning Children's titles or Teen titles and manga.

### Why we lend devices
The concept behind lending has evolved over the years. Originally, the idea was to give access to our large print readers to a new technology where the font size could be enlarged. As the popularity of ebooks and devices has grown, the concept has expanded to expose all patrons to new options from simple single purpose devices to multifunction tablets.
