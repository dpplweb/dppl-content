Just want the fun stuff? Go right to our [Tumblr](http://captaintabbycats.tumblr.com/).

If you’re feeling too grown-up for the children’s floor but not quite ready to be an adult, the third floor of the library is the place to be. It’s officially the Readers’ Services floor, but tucked away in the corner is your little piece of land where you’ll find our graphic novels and our high school collections. 

If manga is your thing, check out our manga collection and maybe join us once a month at [Anime Club](http://calendar.dppl.org/evanced/lib/eventcalendar.asp?ag=&et=Teen+Program&dt=mo&df=calendar&cn=0&private=0&ln=0) where we draw, watch anime, enjoy some Japanese snacks (yes, we have Ramune!) and have lots of laughs.

Do you run out of books to read no matter how many you check out, then our Kindle Paperwhites are perfect for you. They are loaded with an entire library of hot new titles and the Kindle is yours to keep for an entire month!

Our (er, cozy?) Teen Lounge is reserved specifically for you. Drop by any time you want to relax, read, or hang out with your friends. 

If you want to use a computer, but don’t want to go to the fourth floor (sometimes I don’t either) we have teen macs just for you. Stop by the third floor information desk with your school ID and your library card and you will be able to check out a Macbook Pro for at least two hours. You can’t take it home, but you can take it anywhere on the third floor. 

If you need to do some serious school work (and I know you do) check out the top five databases for high school students:  

1. Biography in Context
2. HelpNow
3. Master File Premiew
4. Mas Ultra 
5. Opposting Viewpoints
