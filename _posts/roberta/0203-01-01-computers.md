##Using a Computer at the Library

We want to help you get online. Bring your DPPL library card or a card from your home library and you can sign yourself up for a one hour session. You can also use our wifi throughout the building. We also offer a variety of [computer classes](http://dppl.org/events-programs/computer_classes.shtml) for both beginning and more advanced learners.

###What You Need to Know

- The second floor computers are only for children under 14 or parents helping small children. 

- The fourth floor computers are for adults and older teens.

- The fourth floor also has scanners to scan, email or save pictures and documents to a flash drive.

- Laptops are available for teens with proper ID to check out and use in the third floor Teen Lounge.

- Printing costs ten cents a page for black and white, fifty cents a page for color.

- You can print from the wifi system too, for the same cost. 

- Your DPPL library card is also a copy and print card. Ask the IT staff about purchasing a print card if you can't get a DPPL library card.

###What Other Technology Do We Offer?

We have Nexus tablets, Kindles, Nooks, and other digital devices for you to use in the library and to take home. Ask at the third floor [Readers' Services Desk](mailto:readersservicesdesk@dppl.org) for more information (847-376-2840).
