##Using a Computer at the Library


##Using a Computer at the Library

We want to help you get online. Bring your DPPL library card or a card from your home library and you can sign yourself up for a one hour session. You can also use our wifi throughout the building. We also offer a variety of [computer classes](computer class calendar) for both beginning and more advanced learners.

###What You Need to Know

- The second floor computers are only for children under 14 or parents working with small children. 

- The fourth floor computers are for adults and older teens.

- Laptops are available for teens with proper ID to check out and use in the Teen Lounge.

- Printing costs ten cents a page for black and white, fifty cents a page for color.

- You can print from the wifi system too, for the same cost. 

- Your DPPL library card is also a copy and print card. Ask the IT staff for help.
