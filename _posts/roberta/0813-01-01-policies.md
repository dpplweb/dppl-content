## Important Library Policies

Our policies are driven by community needs, written by staff, and reviewed and revised regularly by the library Board of Trustees. They are written to provide access to information while protecting the privacy of our residents and users. 

###Internet Access Policy

We want everyone to have a productive and safe online experience, and we ask that all computer users in the library follow a few simple rules when they access the internet.

###Meeting Room Policy

Our public meeting rooms are very popular, and so we have developed policy for residents wishing to reserve and use our three first floor meeting rooms. Your group must be a non-profit, pay a booking fee, and have a majority of the group be Des Plaines cardholders.

###Collection Development Policy

Our collection development policy sets purchasing guidelines for everything the library owns. Ours is written with an eye to offering you current, popular, reliable and easily accessible information and entertainment,and covers books, magazines, music, movies, games and electronic resources.
