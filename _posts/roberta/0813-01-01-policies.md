##Getting a Des Plaines Public Library Card

Any resident of incorporated Des Plaines can get a free library card that is good for three years. You must show a photo ID and proof of your residency (like your driver's license, state ID or a utility bill). Kids in 8th grade or younger must bring a parent or guardian who can show a photo ID and proof of their residency.

You can apply on the first floor of the library or use our online application form. If you apply online, you can pick up your new card (and show your ID) in three days. Did you lose your library card? Come to the first floor with ID and we will issue you a new one.

###Don't live in Des Plaines? 

You can use your home library card to check out anything we have in our collection. Bring the card with you and we will register you in our patron database. If you have questions, please call the library at 847-827-5551.

Since Rosemont doesn't have a library, Rosemont residents who live north of Devon Avenue must purchase their cards at the Des Plaines Public Library. Rosemont residents pay 25% or $68.89 for a non-resident card for the entire family for one year. (The Village of Rosemont pays the rest of the fee directly to the Des Plaines Public Library.)

Other Rosemont residents who live south of Devon Avenue should contact the Schiller Park Library for card information and costs. Please call them at 847-678-0433.

###Using Your New Library Card

You can use your card to check out as many items as you want. You can also use your card to sign up for a public computer, to access our student resources from home, and to borrow items that Des Plaines doesn't own from other libraries.
