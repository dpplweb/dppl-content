##Getting Your Library Card

Any resident of incorporated Des Plaines can get a free library card that is good for three years. You must show a photo ID and proof of your residency (like your driver's license, state ID or a utility bill). Kids in 8th grade or younger must bring a parent or guardian who can show a photo ID and proof of their residency.

You can apply on the first floor of the library or use our online application form. If you apply online, you can pick up your new card (and show your ID) in three days.
