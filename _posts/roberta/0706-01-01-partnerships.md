We work with many local organizations to provide great programs and services. Here are some of our community partnerships:


- The Des Plaines Park District works with us to bring storytelling and other activities to their seasonal festivals and in turn supports our annual Battle of the Bands and Des Arts fine art programming.


- The Lattof YMCA welcomes our Youth Services staff into its preschool and sends the Y staff to support healthy eating and excercise programs in the library.


- Local businesses like Millennium Bank, the Greek American Restaurant Association, Village Bank and Trust and . . . have provided funding for Summer Reading Club events and prizes. 


- The Rotary Club of Des Plaines funded the beautiful Rotary Heritage Reading Room on the third floor, as well as other individual programs.
