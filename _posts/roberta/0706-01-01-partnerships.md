We work with many local organizations to provide great programs and services. We'd love to work with your organization too! Please [contact Roberta Johnson](mailto:rjohnson@dppl.org) if you want to know more about funding a program here at the library. Here are some of our community partnerships:


- The Friends of the Des Plaines Public Library have been faithful and prolific fundraisers for more than fifty years, supporting programming for all ages and making generous gifts like our meeting room sound system, our new piano, and other major donations. Please consider joining our Friends group or visiting their regular book sales!

- The Des Plaines Park District works with us to bring storytelling and other activities to their seasonal festivals and in turn supports our annual Battle of the Bands and Des Arts fine art programming.


- The Lattof YMCA welcomes our Youth Services staff into its preschool and sends the Y staff to support healthy eating and excercise programs in the library.


- Local businesses like Millennium Bank, the Greek American Restaurant Association, Village Bank and Trust and . . . have provided financial support for Summer Reading Club events and prizes. 


- The Rotary Club of Des Plaines funded the beautiful Rotary Heritage Reading Room on the third floor, as well as other individual programs.

- Local schools encourage their students to get and use library cards, bring parents and kids on tours of the library, and promote our family programs in their emails and newsletters.

- Oakton Community College is our longtime partner in providing adult literacy, computer instruction and special storytimes to Spanish speakers in the library.

- The Kiwanis Club of Des Plaines is a proud financial supporter of the second floor Early Learning Center (construction beginning in 2014).

Thanks to these organizations and **all** the individuals that help us be the best library we can possibly be.
