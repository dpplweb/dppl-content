The library has earned multiple grants and awards over the years. Here are some of our most recent projects.

**2008 Special Families Need Special Libraries - $13,517**

The Des Plaines Public Library was awarded a $13,517.00 grant by the Illinois State Library for a project entitled "Special Families Need Special Libraries." Library staff wrote this grant to increase awareness of autism and add materials, including books, magazines and DVDs of interest to families affected by autism. The library staff was trained to understand and better serve the special needs of children and adults on the spectrum.
