The library has earned multiple grants and awards over the years. Our primary source of grant opportunities is the Illinois State Library.

**Annual Per Capita Grant**

Every October we apply for a state grant based on our population size. The board and staff decide each year to which special projects these funds will be devoted.

In 2013 we were awarded $59,977.76, which was spent on an e-resources marketing campaign, an Early Literacy Internship, digitization of library materials, the first stage of our Early Learning Center and replacing CD shelving on the third floor.

In past years the Per Capita Grant has been used for the library newsletter, portable scanning equipment, filming select library programs for local cable, translating services, and staff training.

**2013 Library Journal Index**

We received three stars in this national rating of public libraries. The stars are given for success in programming, library visits, public computer usage, and circulation. In 2013 the community borrowed over 1.2 million items from the library, and made over 500,000 library visits!

**2013 Back to the Books - $4,000**

The library spent these funds on books for our World Language collections, particularly in the area of citizenship study and learning English as a second language.


**2008 Special Families Need Special Libraries - $13,517**

Library staff wrote this grant for a year-long project entitled "Special Families Need Special Libraries." Library staff wrote this grant to increase awareness of autism and add materials, including books, magazines and DVDs of interest to families affected by autism. The library staff was trained to understand and better serve the special needs of children and adults on the spectrum.
