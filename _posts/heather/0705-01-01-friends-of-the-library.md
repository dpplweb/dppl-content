## Friends of the Library

###Who are the Des Plaines Friends of the Library? 
We are your neighbors! Founded in 1954, Des Plaines Friends of the Library is a not-for-profit 501c3 organization that raises funds to provide gifts (programs, materials, equipment, and artwork) for the library. The Friends sponsor three yearly used book sales and maintain an ongoing bookshelf located on the first floor, offering used books and magazines for sale throughout the year.

###What Do the Friends Support? 
All during the year, the funds raided by the Friends via book sales and dues support a wide range of library programs designed to appeal to diverse communities in Des Plaines. Toddlers, grade-schoolers, teens, adults and people with special needs benefit from these activities that are made possible by the Friends’ book sales. Friends-supported activities include:

**Adult Programs**
Friends-sponsored activities for adults include Friday evening and Sunday afternoon movies, Wii games, art slide lectures, live performances. Friends also provide funds for adult reading program prizes. 

**Family Programs**	
Many activities supported by the Friends are enjoyed by adults and children alike, suchas Friends Family Sundays and special musical and educations programs. 

**Children's Programs**
Friends sponsor events at the library for children of all ages including Check-Mates Chess Academy and live musical and theatrical performances. Friends also sponsors Rainbow Times, a program that brings autistic children with therapy dogs together to read. Friends also sponsors kids’ summer reading program events and prizes.  In 2013, more than 2,000 children participated in this Friends supported program. 

**Teen Programs**
For teens, the Friends financially supports the annual Battle of the Bands, as well as other programs and events.

###What Do Friends Volunteers Do?
Volunteers of the Friends assist with various library programs including hosting programs, straightening shelves, registering voters, and more.  Friends volunteers also organize and run the Friend’s three annual book sales and maintain the ongoing book sale shelf.  Friends members have access to the book sales prior to the public, an added benefit. Volunteers enjoy the satisfaction of promoting reading and library services to the community.
