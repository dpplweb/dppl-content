## Other ways to make a finanical contribution to the Library:

The following methods should be discussed with your attorney or financial advisor:

- Bequest - Make the Des Plaines Public Library Fund the recipient of part or all of your estate.

- Insurance - Designate the Des Plaines Public Library Fund as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy.

- Stocks, mutual funds and IRA funds - The library has opened a brokerage account so interested persons may make charitable contributions of appreciated or depreciated stocks, mutual funds or IRA funds. By making these donations, you may receive tax advantages.
